# Robotics Knowledge Map

Robotics Knowledge Map is an interactive graphical tool designed to visually represent various robotics courses and their associated subjects. It provides a comprehensive learning experience by displaying courses as parent nodes and their related subjects as child nodes. The user can click and drag the nodes to explore connections and relationships between topics. When a node is selected, a card appears, offering a brief introduction to the topic, providing a more detailed learning experience.

## Features

- **Graphical Representation of Courses and Subjects**  
  Courses are represented as parent nodes with their associated subjects displayed as child nodes. This hierarchy allows for easy exploration of topics and subtopics within the field of robotics.
  
- **Interactive User Interface**  
  Nodes are fully interactive, allowing users to click, drag, and reposition them. This feature offers a dynamic and engaging way to visualize the relationships between various robotics courses and subjects.

- **Informative Cards on Node Selection**  
  Upon selecting a node, a card is displayed with an introductory overview of the topic, helping users to understand the fundamental concepts quickly.

- **Smooth Animations**  
  The map includes smooth animations for node movement, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **Customizable Node Styling**  
  Different node types (courses, subjects and courses with no subjects) are styled uniquely, providing clear visual distinctions.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, the following software must be installed on your system:
